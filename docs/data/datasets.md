# OFO datasets

We are pleased to share [a prototype](https://openforestobservatory.netlify.app/data/) of our field reference data catalog.

We are hard at work on the initial release of our drone imagery catalog. In the meantime, preliminary versions of some of our most frequently requested datasets are linked below. If you don't find what you are looking for here, please [contact us](https://openforestobservatory.org/about/), as we may be able to provide access to additional preliminary datasets that will meet your needs.

### Emerald Point

This is a relatively flat mixed-conifer stand on peninsula on the shore of Lake Tahoe that contains a large (> 3 ha) field based tree map with detailed tree-level attributes. The drone imagery and field reference data linked here were the basis for the [paper by Young et al. (2022)](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13860).

#### Over-canopy drone imagery

The drone imagery datasets linked here have a very high image denstiy. For a more standard image density dataset, see "Emerald Point subset", below.

### Emerald Point subset

This is the same site as above, but it is a smaller footprint with sparser images (a cropped and thinned version of the above) for faster processing time.

#### Over-canopy drone imagery

#### Field reference data

This drone dataset footprint covers the same field reference dataset linked above.


### Stanislaus-Tuolumne Experimental Forest - OFO field plot 0077

#### Over-canopy drone imagery

[120 m nadir](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/4hdivzmejv0y4nxz6u5rsvu73qjz1m16)

[80 m oblique (35 deg)](https://ucdavis.box.com/s/cx3a2ah30lcoi9qqrm7rxr0zgciztb0b)

#### Under-canopy imagery

This imagery was collected by walking a serpentine ("lawnmower") pattern in a portion of the stand with a GoPro on a 2 m pole set to record one 360 degree spherical image every 2 seconds.
